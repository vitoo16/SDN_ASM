## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or MongoDB Atlas)
- npm or yarn

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd SDN_ASM
npm install
cd frontend && npm install
cd ..
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Create `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/perfume_db
JWT_SECRET=your-very-secret-jwt-key-here-make-it-long-and-secure
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=30d
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Create `frontend/.env`:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

### 3. Database Setup

Seed the database with sample data:

```bash
node seed.js
```

This creates:
- **Admin User**: admin@myteam.com / admin123
- **Regular User**: user@example.com / user123
- Sample brands and perfumes

### 4. Start the Application

**Backend** (Terminal 1):
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Frontend** (Terminal 2):
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

The application will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:5000
